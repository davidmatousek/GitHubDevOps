### 8. **🔴 SECURITY REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION** - HIGH
**Status:** 🚨 **NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**
- **Files:** `.github/workflows/swift.yml`
- **Issue:** Comprehensive security scanning removed due to YAML formatting issues
- **Action Items:**
  - [ ] **URGENT:** Re-implement automated security review in GitHub Actions
  - [ ] Fix YAML formatting issues that prevented deployment
  - [ ] Add hardcoded secret detection back to CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Include unsafe Swift pattern detection in workflow
  - [ ] Ensure security checks run before builds and block insecure code
